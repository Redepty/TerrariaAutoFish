<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>It's bot written in Python that can catch crates automatically, the only thing it needs is sonar potion</p>

<h2>How to use?</h2>
<p>Remove all potions from your inventory, except for fishing potions, otherwise you will no longer
have potions, if your button for drinking all potions is not b, then change it to b then place the cursor so that
the label from sonar potion was in the small window, and turn on the bot</p>

<h2>How to catch another items by bot?</h2>
<p>You can write your items in <b>loot.txt</b>, by default there are crates (crate) and oysters there</p>

<p>sorry 4 bad english</p>
